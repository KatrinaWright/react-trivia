# react-trivia
Project 4b for Joy of coding Explorer Board

## Project Details:

You are doing AMAZING! ðŸ¤© ðŸ’« Nothing can stop you now! ðŸ”¥

Now that you have some basic react under your belt, youâ€™re ready to put your new knowledge into use! Youâ€™re going to create your first solo project from scratch.

We hope you enjoy trivia because your next assignment is to create a Trivia app in React! The project requirements are a little further down on this card, you can check them off as you achieve them.

Take your time and review the previous videos, written material, and another bonus walkthrough video linked in the comments to help guide your next steps.

Plan to spend up to 3-10 days on this project since itâ€™s your very first solo react project...less if you have prior react experience, and maybe more if you are brand new. 5-7 days is an average middle ground for someone who is comfortable with javascript but new to react. If youâ€™re new to both, donâ€™t feel like you have a time limit. Ask questions!

Spend up to thirty minutes reviewing how to install a new react app using Vite. Mosh covered this at the start of the last video tutorial.

If you donâ€™t have your React Vite app installed on your local computer after 30 minutes, itâ€™s time to ask for help in the channels. We want you to enjoy the process of creating from scratch and not get stuck tryin get get started.

Ask questions in the Explorer channel on Discord when you are stuck and/or attend any of the explorer focused Q&As during the week.
